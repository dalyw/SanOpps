These training sessions may cover topics such as effective sanitation infrastructure management, the implementation of sanitation policies, and strategies for improving service delivery.", "This refers to the reduction in healthcare costs as a result of decreased cases of diarrhea, which is often linked to poor sanitation. Improved sanitation reduces the occurrence of diarrheal diseases, leading to fewer treatments and thus lowering the unit cost per treatment.", "This component measures the reduction in deaths caused by diarrheal diseases, which are often attributed to inadequate sanitation. By improving sanitation infrastructure and hygiene practices, the incidence of these diseases declines, resulting in fewer fatalities.", "This refers to the reduction in the number of illness cases, particularly those related to diarrheal diseases, due to improved sanitation facilities and practices.

Improved sanitation reduces the incidence of waterborne diseases and other health issues, leading to fewer sick days and higher attendance at work and school", "This component measures the value of time saved by working adults due to improved sanitation. When sanitation is poor, people often spend a significant amount of time dealing with health issues, accessing clean water, or traveling to distant facilities. Improved sanitation reduces these time burdens, allowing adults to allocate more time to productive activities, thus enhancing economic output.", "This measures the economic impact of time saved for school-going children due to better sanitation facilities. Improved sanitation in schools and communities reduces the time children spend absent due to illness, fetching water, or lacking adequate sanitation facilities.", "This refers to the economic gains resulting from increased tourism, which is often influenced by the quality of sanitation in a city or region. Improved sanitation infrastructure enhances the appeal of a location to tourists, leading to higher tourist arrivals and spending.", "This component captures the economic benefits associated with the reuse of treated wastewater. Properly treated wastewater can be reused for various purposes, such as irrigation, industrial processes, or even non-potable urban uses. The reuse of treated wastewater reduces the demand for freshwater resources, lowers costs for water extraction and treatment, and provides an additional revenue stream.", "This component measures the economic value of productive years lost due to the death of children aged 0 to 4 years, caused by diseases related to poor sanitation. Improved sanitation reduces mortality rates in this age group, preserving future productive years that would have been lost.", "This component calculates the economic value of productive years lost due to the death of children aged 5 to 14 years from sanitation-related diseases. Like the younger age group, improvements in sanitation can prevent deaths in this demographic, preserving additional years of productivity that these children would have contributed to the economy as they grow older.", "This measures the economic value of productive years lost due to the death of individuals aged 15 years and older from diseases related to poor sanitation. Improved sanitation can significantly reduce mortality in this age group by preventing deaths from waterborne diseases, infections, and other health issues.", "This component represents the economic value associated with each year of life lost due to poor sanitation. The opportunity cost per year of life lost is the potential economic contribution that an individual would have made if they had not died prematurely from sanitation-related diseases.
